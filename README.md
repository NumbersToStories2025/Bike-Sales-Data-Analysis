### Data Cleaning
In the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

2. Removing duplicates
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA phase asked the following questions: 
1. What are the sales trends by region?
2. What are the sales trends by different demographics?
3. What are the sales trends by commute distance?

### Data Analysis
Pivot Tables used to answer questions during EDA

### Results
1. United States leads bike sales 
2. Males buy more bikes than women
3. Most bikes are purchased for a short commute (0-1 miles)

### Recommendations
